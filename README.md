# React-JS-login-template

// Given a stateless functional component, add state to it
// state should have a property called `isLoggedIn` which is a boolean
// (true if logged in, false if not)
// Then, give your best shot at rendering the word "in" if the user is logged in
// or "out" if the user is logged out.
